# E-Commerce Mobile App

A cross-platform e-commerce mobile application built with **React Native Expo** and **TypeScript**. 
Build Android, IOS and Web app.

The app features:
- Product Listing
- Product Details Page
- Favorites
- Add to Cart
- How it works:

The app fetches the product listing from the Mocki API and displays the product image, name, and price. On mobile devices, a single product is shown per row, while on the web, two products are displayed per row, fully responsive.

Each product has an Add to Cart button. When a user taps or clicks this button, the product is saved in the basket, and the button is disabled with the text "Added".

At the bottom tab, there is a Cart tab showing a basket icon and the text "Cart". Tapping this tab displays all products added to the cart. Users can:

Add multiple products individually.
Increase the quantity of a product by tapping the "+" button.
Decrease the quantity by tapping the "-" button.
Remove a single item by clicking the trash icon (in red).
Clear the entire cart by clicking the "Clear Cart" button.
When a user clicks on a product, they are taken to the Product Details Page, which shows the product image, title, price, description, and a Favorite toggle button.

If a user adds a product to favorites, it will appear in the Favorites tab (icon: heart, text: "Favorite"). Users can remove products from favorites by navigating to the product detail page and toggling the "Remove from Favorite" button. Multiple products can be added to the favorites list.

Technical Decisions and Architecture Choices
1. State Management Approach and Rationale

The app uses React Redux for global state management.

Rationale:

Centralized management of the cart and favorite products.

Simplifies data sharing across multiple screens and components.

Predictable state updates with Redux Toolkit, reducing boilerplate.

Local component state (via useState) is used for UI-specific interactions, such as toggling the Add to Cart or Favorite buttons.

2. Component Architecture Decisions

Component-based structure:

ProductList â€“ Displays a list of products fetched from the API.

ProductItem â€“ Individual product card used in the list.

ProductDetail â€“ Detailed view of a selected product.

Cart â€“ Displays all products added to the cart with quantity management.

Favorites â€“ Displays products marked as favorite.

Rationale:

Reusable components reduce code duplication.

Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability.

Supports responsive design for mobile and web layouts.

3. Data Persistence Strategy

Cart and Favorites data are persisted using Redux-Persist with AsyncStorage (for mobile) or localStorage (for web).

Rationale:

Ensures that user data remains intact across app restarts or page refreshes.

Provides a seamless user experience without requiring backend storage for temporary data.

4. Performance Considerations

Virtualized lists (FlatList) are used for product listings to render only visible items.

Memoization with React.memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Lazy loading images to reduce initial load time and memory usage.

Responsive design ensures minimal layout recalculation on different devices.

5. Security Considerations

API endpoints accessed over HTTPS to protect data in transit.

Sensitive data (if any, such as user tokens) is stored securely in AsyncStorage or SecureStore.

Input validation is applied to prevent potential UI-level issues.

6. Testing Strategy

Unit Testing: Using Jest to test Redux slices, utility functions, and individual components.

Integration Testing: Using React Native Testing Library to verify component interactions (e.g., adding to cart, toggling favorites).

Manual Testing: Across mobile and web platforms to ensure responsiveness and proper functionality.
